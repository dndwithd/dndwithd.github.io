<hr id="overview"><br>
The world is composed of many places that are very distant by conventional travel, but easily traversed by the <a href="#mists">guides</a> who can summon the <a href="#mists">mists</a>. The areas between these places are designated wastes, as there is often very little in the way of useful life, and very much in the way of space. There is day and night, but no seasons or stars, a sun and a moon, but with no phases or seasonal variations. Areas vary in climate from arctic to tropical, and socially from primative and tribal, to sprawling, almost modern, cities fueled by a mix of technology and <a href="#magic">magic</a>. The general technological level is much like our world before industrial steam, though magic makes up for much of the difference in the most advanced areas. <a href="#guilds">Guilds</a> are the primary social structure. There's a guild for everything, and religions exist as guilds. Most people are a member of several, and by that are often allied with many.
<br><br>

The world is the destination of a <a href="#story">rift</a> that has punctured many dimensions. It has existed for ages, hence many <a href="#races">races and cultures</a> have fallen through and adaped, though very few of the modern population know anyone who came through the rift. A few of those who have fallen through, often referred to simply as <a href="#fallen">'fallen'</a>, and more who are native, have the ability to summon the mists. They are designated guides, and once having found a place where the mists can be summoned, can do so when present and travel, with company, to any place they know that the mists can be summoned, with ease. The best guides are renowned for the places they can go, and the people they know there, the worst strive to not let the stories of thier misadventure or deceit get back to the guild.
<br><br>

In society, there are <a href="#places">public and private places</a>. Public places are goverened by individuals declared guild memberships, and the <a href="#council">Council of Guilds</a> agreed principals. Each individual is responsible for their public behavior to the guilds of which they are members, and the guilds are then ultimately responsible for the actions of their members in many situations. Private places bear seals that denote the guilds whose rules govern all peoples behaivor within thier bounds. For instance, a thief may steal in public, though if caught they may be brought before the council and a price may be paid. Stealing certian items, or from those bearing the sign of certian guilds could be a serious mistake, as the results may land on the guild. However bringing anything of value into a place goverened by the thieves, unless under some variety of protection, is almost certian to invite it's loss. Entering a private place is to accept it's terms, so most are sure to only enter those places whose signs they know and trust, though regional tolerances may vary wildly.
<br><br>

<hr id="races">
<h2>Races:</h2>
<hr><br>

The world has long been the bottom of a very deep pit, piercing many places, thus just about every race has fallen through at some point. Some races are rare, as maybe they simply haven't encountered it, or maybe they instinctively avoid it. Others are, however, quite common. most of the curious races (humans, dwarves, elves, and most of the other usual player races) are variably common, generally by wisdom. The exceedingly wise, or unwise (dragons, orks) are more rare, though the unwise occur more often than the wise.
<br><br>

Also of note is that many more cultures have fallen through than races, thus there is usually more than one culture per race for the more common races. For instance, in one culture, halflings may be timid, placid, farmers and tinkerers, while in another, they may be reclusive, and war-like, hunter-gatherers.
<br><br>

Players must thus consider, that in this world, any race may be present at any time, and that simply being a member of one race, or another, does not dictate an individuals views on any given subject as a rule.
<br><br>

<hr id="guilds">
<h2>Guilds: WIP</h2>
<hr><br>

Guilds are the primary social structures in this society, and as a result, determine much of an individual's social status and behavior in the world. An individual's public behavior is governed by thier declared guild memberships, and if they violate the rules of any of thier orders in public, they may be held accountable. 
<br><br>

Guild members are widely expected, though not required, to show a public sign of membership. Usually this is shown as a talisman commonly carried on a chain around the wrist or neck, or displayed prominently on a piece of traveling garb such as a staff or cloak. Undeclared guilds may not be honored in negotiations regarding any infraction. A thief, hiding his status as a thief, may pay a price for picking a pocket, where as, if he declared it, he would not. 
<br><br>

Some guilds have made the arrangement to hide behind others, such as the thieves and assasins. An assasin may be backed by the thieves, when bearing thier logo as a proxy, provided he kept to thier treaties, and those of the other marks he declared. Hence a lawful neutral assasin, identified as a thief, might be well within his right, once hired, to kill a chaotic neutral fighter who decided to rampage through a pub full of innocent people last week, while if he were only a thief, such acion would amount to murder.
<br><br id="council">

Disputes are moderated by the council of guilds, in which each guild acts like a political party in something like a parliment or congress. Alliances may be made to strengthen the position of the allied guilds on matters on which they agree. In a given place, each guild may designate one or more representatives to the council to speak on it's behalf, or if there is no representative designated, may be spoken for by any proven member. A guild's representative carries the weight of that guild's declared membership in that area compared to the other guilds on the council. For instance, a thief stealing in a town without an established thieves guild is entitled to speak for themselves with the weight of all other declared thieves, and call on alliances with other guilds that may affect the result of the dispute. The thieves guild may have made an alliance with the Golden Pillar, or Claws of Light, such that a proven member, caught stealing less than a meal worth of food, in a nonviolent way, with no possessions of value, should be pardoned; or the commerce guild when not stealing from a designated business or market; or the builders guild when not stealing from within a structure, etc. Given appropriate circumstances, they could then add these votes to those of thier own guild members like a congressional jury with those in dispute able to call on thier parties to back them. However if the thief is accused by a farmer, in a town where they are the only declared thief, in a population of mostly farmers, it would be quite the uphill battle without some sort of sympathetic ear. If most of those farmers were also members of the Golden Pillar, or Claws of Light though, and the thief were within bounds of the alliance, things might balance out quite differently.

<hr id="places">
<h2>Places:</h2>
<hr><br>
places are governed in one of two ways. either as public places, where each guilds members are expected to behave according to the agreed public principals, or as private places, where the laws of the guilds whose symbols they bear take precedence. generally, though cerianly not exclusively, any place without a seperation from the sky is considered public, and with said seperation may be private, though many open-air gardens and theatres are notable private exceptions, as are covered stalls in most markets public exceptions, even when contained by a doorway. usually though, such doorways do not contain an actual door, and if they do, may certianly be private.
<br><br>

<h3>Public Places:</h3><br>
in a public place all members of every guild are expected to conform to that guild's agreed public principals. in public, a thief may steal, or warrior kill, but only within certian circumstances, lest they be held accountable. a paladin killing someone as part of a robbery is at serious risk from their guild, just as they would be for allowing a murderer to run free, and a chaotic evil assasin is at equal risk for sparing thier target as they would be for revealing themselves to stop a petty theft. any of those scenarios may be overcome by other circumstances, but rarely without the intervention of the council if they are witnessed, and a complaint lodged.
<br><br>

<h3>Private Places:</h3><br>
private places are expected, nearly everywhere, to be marked outside of a "closable doorway" with the symbols of the guilds whose rules govern conduct within thier walls. this is often done on the opening side of the door, vertically, with most important at the top. in many places, moreso with higher level, if the door is not closed, those rules will be enforced by the council in a 'soft' manner, though almost uiversally, opening a closed door, bearing the symbol of one guild or another, is a clear sign of the accptance of that guilds rules, and any violation of the maked guilds rules within those walls may be dealt with harshly. the symbols, to be truely official, must also bear the mark of a witness (a wizard signing that they have seen the mark in it's place as of a certian date) to prevent the addition of a mark after an incident, thus making a party appear guilty of an infraction they may have been unaware they were commiting.

<br><br><hr id="magic">
<h2>Magic in the World:</h2>
<hr><br>

this is a very magic heavy world. most towns or villages have at least one magic user, though the quality varies. in the cities, there are whole schools, through the guilds, to teach many types. a few of these, healers for instance, train many students. 
<br><br>

magic is considered a valid profession. it is not uncommon in many areas to hire a mage or priest to perform a spell for a given purpose, or maybe to craft a magical item or scroll. magical items are, as a result, somewhat common, though some types are much more common than others, and some are outright banned resulting in a potential black market. prices and/or quality sometimes vary wildly depending on if they are crafted locally or imported, and how many mages can cast the required spells
<br><br>

in more advanced places, magic acts much like technology does for us, and enchanted items play a part in daily life. one such way is signing magic. much like magical notaries, signing mages 'witness' an event or fact with a conditional wizard mark, such that if the signed item changes in any way, the mark vanishes. other uses include the making of magical items for the lighting lamps, or simply producing light, heating or cooling, navigation and safety, astetic appearance, even as pumps for water or fuel
<br><br>

<h3>Magical Items:</h3>
<br>

magical items are fairly common in higher level areas. most are not very powerful, but usable many times or for long periods. many of the items are created by very skilled wizards, maybe (need?) can be recharged by lesser ones, which would make for a considerable economy. such items include:

<ul>
<li><b>witness:</b> 
a witnessed item is signed by the wizard witnessing it. the wizard places a mark on it which indicates who the witness is, and when it was witnessed in it's current sate. maybe with an indicator of how thoroughly it's state was witnessed, or specifier of how thoroughly it must be maintained. if a witnessed item changes state sufficiently, the wizard mark will vanish. often used to ensure the safe transit of cargo, and authenticity of documents.
<br>(wizard mark;1)
</li>

<li><b>fire nail:</b> 
a metal match whose tip will always burn when in air. it can be extinguished by placing it back in it's case, or depriving it of air in which to burn. often used both in the home and by travelers for lighting fire of many types
<br>(flaming sphere;2)
</li>

<li><b>hot or cold stone:</b> 
a stone that keeps it's designated temperature, from freezing to boiling, regardless of it's surroundings. often used for refrigeration or heat in many contexts
<br>(fire shield;4)
</li>

<li><b>light charm:</b> 
much like any other light source, though with little to no heat. with a skilled creator, color may be chosen, or even variable. often used in cities and palaces for the lighting of public spaces at night, occasionally by travelers, thieves, or the wealthy.
<br>(light;1)
</li>

<li><b>paired charms:</b> 
a pair of charms that will always reach toward each other. often hung from a necklace that, when dangled, will lean toward the other charm regardless of it's distance, though it will lean further as it gets closer. often used by travelers to reunite the party, applied to wagons or chests to track valuable cargo, or by smugglers to find hidden goods.
<br>(locate object;2)
</li>

<li><b>illusion charms:</b> 
most often to change the colors of fabrics or hair, though with a skilled creator, the options are nearly endless. often used by performers, the fasionable in high society, or in the underground as a means of disguise
</li>

<li><b>storage space:</b> 
an item that is larger on the inside than it is outside. maybe it's interior space is proportional to it's interface surface (maybe vol^3 = surface^2*10? so 1m^2 surface = 10m^3 volume, maybe apparent volume = 1/10th actual volume or less, based on quality. similarly, weight may be 1/100th or less). maybe a market for garments with "pockets". often used by traders, smugglers, thieves, wizards, or the wealthy, occasionally by travelers.
<br>(deep pockets;2)
</li>

<li><b>magic fan:</b> 
produces the movement of air through a defined gap which becomes faster as the gap becomes smaller.
<br>(gust of wind;3)
</li>

<li><b>magic filter:</b> 
pumps water through a filter at a rate defined by it's quality and size. most will pump water until the filter clogs, then they will need to be serviced by a wizard. often carried by traveling companies, and by wasteland or wealthy travelers. large versions are used in advanced areas to provide water distribution
</li>
</ul>

<br><br><hr id="mists">
<h2>The Guides and The Mists:</h2>
<hr><br>

there is an odd phenomenon in the world referred to as 'the mists'. on an occasional basis, for reasons no one really understands, certian areas will become enshrouded by mist. as one ventures into the mist the terrain will become dry, flat, rocky, and barren, the sky will go dark, and the only natural light to be found will be a dim glow in the mist along the ground. lights carried by travelers will seem as bright, but also have an unusually short range. wandering in the mists is quite dangerous without a guide, as they will often vanish as quickly as they came for similarly inexplicable reasons, leaving any who've wandered in trapped and unable to return. very few who've entered the mists without a guide have ever returned, but all who have have told a very similar story of a nearly endless place with no notable variations trapped in an endless misty night.
<br><br>

there are also people, who've become known as guides, who have the ability to summon the mists to any place they might naturally occur at any time. once within the mists they also have the ability to summon an exit at any other place the mists would naturally occur, giving them the ability to create massive short cuts in travel around the world, and even to travel to places where conventional travel would be all but impossible, such as the tops of mesas with vertical walls hundreds of feet high, or small islands in the middle of the remote seas. not all of these destinations are desirable, but many major cities have mists near by, and some have even grown because of the mists.
<br><br>

mist travel is often prohibitively, due to the small number of guides, hence traveling companies have formed. these companies will hire the guide, and procure wagons and horses, or other pack animals as needed, in order to bring travelers and cargo to remote locations. this is the way most people would travel if they had more than a few days ride, as with enough people or cargo, the price is distributed and becomes much more affordable. there are also bandits who prey on these companies in the hope of snatching valuable cargo, or kidnapping travelers for ransom, so many traveling companies will employ armed fighters to protect the company. while this is rarely a problem in the more developed areas of the world, it can be quite common in the more rural parts. in some places it is common for the company to prepare bribes for the bandits such that they'll be satisfied with the bribe, and leave the travelers and cargo alone. it is alleged that some companies are in fact in league with some of these bandits to shake down travelers for extra money or valuable items they may be carrying.


<br><br><hr id="fallen">
<h2>The fallen in current society:</h2>
<hr><br>

the fallen in current society are something of the stuff of legend. everyone knows someone, who knows someone, who claims to know of one. they are often viewed questionably due to the many rumors about various abilities, powers, curses, etc. they mave have, or be able to bestow. these rumors vary wildly from place to place, and the vast majority are completely groundless. in some places they are rumored to be shapechangers, in others to be cursed with some dire affliction that they will spread to all who come into contact with them, and in yet others to be able to travel the mists on a whim, from anywhere, to anywhere. 
<br><br>

they are also marked by their white hair, and almost albino appearance. in some places they are subject to much prejudice, and as a result, so are all albinos. there is a special guild for the fallen which has made a number of alliances to support the safety of those who have come through the rift. importantly among them is the alliance with the illusionists for subtle charms that will allow them to hide their hair, and anything else that may have changed during their fall.
<br><br>

some of the fallen have turned their plight to benefit by signing on to something akin to freak shows to tell their stories of where they came from, and how they came to fall into the rift. others were skilled in a valuable trade before their fall, and have either managed to keep their status hidden, or been lucky enough to find somewhere where they are not much troubled by it.
<br><br><hr id="story">
<h2>The story of one who fell through the rift:</h2>
<hr><br>

I awoke naked, save my one priceless item, in what appeared to be a dimly lit fog over a barren landscape. No sun, moon, or stars, just the soft glow that lit the ground. I wandered aimlessly for quite some time, and eventually found myself, quite suddenly, in what appeared to be an endless plain. Nothing but silent, empty grasslands as far as could be seen, with a few sparse larger bushes and a stream here and there. So I traveled, and time passed, though I now have no idea how long. There was day and night, but no variation I could discern in their lengths, no stars, but a sun, and a moon with no phases. There was weather, but no seasons, no way to track longer than a simple count of days, and far too many of those passed for that. Eventually, I began to encounter trees and ponds, fish and birds. sparse at first, but they became more common slowly. Then hills and forest, and all manner of animals.

<br><br>

Then, one day, people! Though only a few at first, and living in a very sorry state of raw material huts, few sources of food, and little common language. I helped them to explore the world, and reminded them of some of the things they seemed to have lost in who knows how long they'd been there. Eventually more began to arrive. Mostly humans, but the occasional elf, or dwarf as well. Welcome company. After a time, a human generation or so, a modest village had grown.

<br><br>

I stayed for quite some time, pleased with the company I'd found after all that time alone. Many generations passed, the village grew large, and I wandered on again, spurred on by the stories of new arrivals. This time finding new villages like the one I'd watched grow, though by now there were many races, even some of the magical and monsterous ones wandering the land. I'd even heard tales of dragons!

<br><br>

I began hearing of guilds, and in seeking them out, found again many of the wonders I'd lost when I was put here. Eventually I found mages capable of casting great and wonderous spells, and bonding spirits to objects, guides able to travel between places almost effortlessly, and craftsman able to create devices I barely remembered, lit streets, running water, beautiful garments, wondrous music, art, and food. Over time I established many places throughout the land, and made many friends, traveling between them as my whims suited me.
